This is something you could do using a hidden helper symbol like<br>
<br>
config DRMA_ASPEED_GFX<br>
         bool "Aspeed display driver"<br>
         select DRM_WANT_CMA<br>
<br>
config DRM_WANT_CMA<br>
         bool<br>
         help<br>
            Select this from any driver that benefits from CMA being enabled<br>
<br>
config DMA_CMA<br>
         bool "Use CMA helpers for DRM"<br>
         default DRM_WANT_CMA<br>
<br>
           Arnd<br>

That's precisely what I had first, with an additional "WANT_CMA" --  but<br>
looking at the number of such existing options (I was able to spot 1 !)<br>

If you do this it probably makes sense to fix a few other drivers<br>
Kconfig in the process. It's not just a problem with your driver.<br>
"my" drivers:<br>

:) I actually wanted to convert them to "depends on DMA_CMA" but ran 
into recursive dependencies ...

I was assuming these are "real" dependencies. Will it also work without 
DMA_CMA?

certainly needs this as well, and pretty much anything that is<br>
selecting DRM_KMS_CMA_HELPER or<br>
DRM_GEM_CMA_HELPER "wants" DMA_CMA.<br>

<br>
"wants" as in "desires to use but can life without" or "wants" as in 
"really needs it". ?
