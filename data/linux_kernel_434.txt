I think it mostly holds: GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP should always be used if there<br>
is a reasonably straight-forward interrupts whether cascaded or hierarchical.<br>
Very few exceptions there. If there is one IRQ line per GPIO<br>
line, the hierarchical support should be used as outlined. GPIO_REGMAP<br>
should be mostly (famous last words) orthogonal.<br>
