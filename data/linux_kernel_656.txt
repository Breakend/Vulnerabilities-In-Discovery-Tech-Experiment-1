KVM_GET_EMULATED_CPUID returns -E2BIG if the nent field of<br>
struct kvm_cpuid2 is smaller than the actual entries, while<br>
it adjusts nent if the provided amount is bigger than the<br>
actual amount.<br>
<br>
Update documentation accordingly. ENOMEM is just returned if the<br>
allocation fails, like all other calls.<br>

 Userspace invokes KVM_GET_EMULATED_CPUID by passing a kvm_cpuid2<br>
