The driver was assuming that all the parameters would be valid. But it<br>
is possible that parameters are sent from userspace. For those cases,<br>
appropriate error checks have been added.<br>

Are you sure this change is necessary for vhci_hcd? Is there a<br>
scenario where vhci_hcd will receive these values from userspace?<br>

I'm not sure if these changes are necessary for vhci_hcd. I'd sent<br>
this patch following the motivation of a patch (c318840fb2) from<br>
dummy_hcd to handle some cases. Yeah, there is scenario where vhci_hcd<br>
will receive these values from userspace. For example, typReq =<br>
SetPortFeature and wValue = USB_PORT_FEAT_C_CONNECTION can be received<br>
from userspace. As USB_PORT_FEAT_C_CONNECTION case isn't being<br>
handled, default case will is executed for it. So I'm assuming<br>
USB_PORT_FEAT_C_CONNECTION isn't supported and default case shouldn't<br>
be executed.<br>
<br>

<br>
The way dummy_hcd handles USB_PORT_FEAT_C_CONNECTION isn't applicable<br>
to vhci_hcd.<br>
<br>
rh_port_connect() and  rh_port_disconnect() set the 
USB_PORT_FEAT_C_CONNECTION this flag to initiate port status polling.
<br>
This flag is set by the driver as a result of attach/deatch request<br>
from the user-space. Current handling of this flag is correct.<br>

I'm not able to reproduce any problem. But typReq = SetPortFeature and<br>
wValue = USB_PORT_FEAT_C_CONNECTION may trigger some behavior which<br>
isn't intended as USB_PORT_FEAT_C_CONNECTION may not be supported for<br>
vhci_hcd.<br>

<br>
If you reproduce the problem and it impacts attach/detach and device<br>
remote device access, we can to look into this further.<br>
