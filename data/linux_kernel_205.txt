By standard slot, I mean you have standard voltage rails 12V and 3.3V <br>
(or 1.5 and 3.3 for mini PCIe) and PERST# signal, no other extra <br>
things to make a device discoverable, and the timing for <br>
those rails and PERST# follow what the spec defines.<br>
<br>
There's also CLKREQ, WAKE, and hotplug detect signals, but I think those <br>
are all optional and could be tied off. I think most PCI h/w is not <br>
hotplug capable.<br>
