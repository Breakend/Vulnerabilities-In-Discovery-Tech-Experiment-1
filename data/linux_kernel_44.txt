Hello,<br>
<br>
after my last patch got accepted and is now in net as commit<br>
3e6fdeb28f4c33 ("net: dsa: lantiq_gswip: Let GSWIP automatically set<br>
the xMII clock") [0] some more people from the OpenWrt community<br>
(many thanks to everyone involved) helped test the GSWIP driver: [1]<br>
<br>
It turns out that the previous fix does not work for all boards.<br>
There's no regression, but it doesn't fix as many problems as I<br>
thought. This is why two more fixes are needed:<br>
- the first one solves many (four known but probably there are<br>
  a few extra hidden ones) reported bugs with the GSWIP where no<br>
  traffic would flow. Not all circumstances are fully understood<br>
  but testing shows that switching away from PHY auto polling<br>
  solves all of them<br>
- while investigating the different problems which are addressed<br>
  by the first patch some small issues with the existing code were<br>
  found. These are addressed by the second patch<br>
<br>
<br>
Changes since v1 at [0]:<br>
- Don't configure the link parameters in gswip_phylink_mac_config<br>
  (as we're using the "modern" way in gswip_phylink_mac_link_up).<br>
  Thanks to Andrew for the hint with the phylink documentation.<br>
- Clarify that GSWIP_MII_CFG_RMII_CLK is ignored by the hardware in<br>
  the description of the second patch as suggested by Hauke<br>
- Don't set GSWIP_MII_CFG_RGMII_IBS in the second patch as we don't<br>
  have any hardware available for testing this. The patch<br>
  description now also reflects this.<br>
- Added Andrew's Reviewed-by to the first patch (thank you!)<br>
<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
Martin<br>
