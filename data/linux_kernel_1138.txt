Hi all,<br>
<br>
After merging the irqchip tree, today's linux-next build (x86_64<br>
allmodconfig) failed like this:<br>
<br>
drivers/irqchip/irq-wpcm450-aic.c:9:10: fatal error: asm/exception.h:<br>
No such file or directory<br>
    9 | #include <asm/exception.h><br>
      |          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Caused by commit<br>
<br>
  fead4dd49663 ("irqchip: Add driver for WPCM450 interrupt controller")<br>
<br>
I have used the irqchip tree from next-20210407 for today.<br>

Thanks for the heads up. I guess that's the effect of COMPILE_TEST<br>
which was apparently not very well tested... I'll drop it from Kconfig.<br>
<br>
Jonathan, feel free to submit something re-enabling COMPILE_TEST once<br>
you've worked out the missing dependencies.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
