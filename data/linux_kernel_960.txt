I think these attributes are quite useful information to have available so<br>
I'd go actually doing sysfs attributes and create<br>
Documentation/ABI/stable/sysfs-driver-sgx to document them.<br>
<br>
Given that they would go then to the sysfs directory of the driver, then<br>
probably the legit names for the attributes ought to be:<br>
<br>
- nr_all_epc_pages<br>
- nr_free_epc_pages<br>
<br>
What do you think?<br>
<br>
PS. One useful case that I forgot to mention is that I use these to give<br>
idea what I gave EPC size in the BIOS. Now my EPC is set to 32 MB, and<br>
these report 20 MB of EPC pages. It's because other metadata (e.g. EPCM<br>
containing page attributes) is also stored in this area.<br>
