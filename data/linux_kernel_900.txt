It is a somewhat awkward way to say "prevent this symbol from<br>

What would be the right thing to do in the case here then to achieve the<br>

One approach could be to have for DMA_CMA<br>
<br>
default y if DRMA_ASPEED_GFX<br>
<br>
but it feels like the wrong way to tackle this.<br>

I'm still not sure what you are trying to achieve. Is the idea only to provide<br>
a useful default for DMA_CMA depending on which drivers are enabled?<br>

"Random drivers should not override a user configuration of core knobs<br>
(e.g., CONFIG_DMA_CMA=n)."<br>
<br>
Let's assume I'm a distribution and want to set CONFIG_CMA=n or want to 
set CONFIG_DMA_CMA=n with CONFIG_CMA=y; there is no way to do that with 
e.g., DRMA_ASPEED_GFX=y because it will always override my (user!) 
setting -- even though it doesn't really always need it. Using "select" 
is the problem here.

This is something you could do using a hidden helper symbol like<br>
<br>
config DRMA_ASPEED_GFX<br>
        bool "Aspeed display driver"<br>
        select DRM_WANT_CMA<br>
<br>
config DRM_WANT_CMA<br>
        bool<br>
        help<br>
           Select this from any driver that benefits from CMA being enabled<br>
<br>
config DMA_CMA<br>
        bool "Use CMA helpers for DRM"<br>
        default DRM_WANT_CMA<br>
<br>

That's precisely what I had first, with an additional "WANT_CMA" --  but 
looking at the number of such existing options (I was able to spot 1 !) 
I wondered if there is a better approach to achieve the same; "imply" 
sounded like a good candidate.
