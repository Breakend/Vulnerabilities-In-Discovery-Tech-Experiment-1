So this issue is blocking the LLVM upgrading on ChromeOS. Nathan, do<br>
you mind sending out the smaller patch like Nick suggested just to see<br>
what feedback we could get? I could send it for you if you are busy,<br>
and please let me know what tags I should use in that case.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
