Does this patch fix the problem?<br>

<br>
The beacon seems to be updating now and STAs no longer get stuck in PS<br>
mode.<br>
Although sometimes (every 2-3 minutes with continuous 1s interval pings)<br>
there is around 5s delay in updating the transmitted beacon - don't know<br>
why, maybe the NIC hardware still has the old version in queue?<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
Since USB device doesn't update every beacon, dtim_count isn't updated neither.<br>
It leads STA doesn't awake properly. Please try to fix dtim_period=1 in<br>
hostapd.conf, which tells STA awakes every beacon interval.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
The situation is the same with dtim_period=1.<br>
<br>
When I look at a packet trace (captured from a different NIC running in<br>
monitor mode) it's obvious that the pinged STA wakes up almost<br>
immediately once it sees its DTIM bit set in a beacon.<br>
<br>
But many beacons pass (the network has beacon interval of 0.1s) between<br>
where a ping request (ICMP echo request) is buffered on the AP and where<br>
the transmitted beacon actually starts to have DTIM bit set.<br>
<br>
I am observing delays up to 9 seconds, which means a delay up to 90<br>
beacons between when DTIM bit should be set and when it actually gets<br>
set.<br>
<br>
As I said above, this happens only sometimes (every 2-3 minutes with<br>
continuous 1s interval pings) but there is definitely something wrong<br>
here.<br>
<br>
My wild guess would be that if the NIC is prevented from sending a beacon<br>
due to, for example, its radio channel being busy it keeps that beacon<br>
in queue for the next transmission attempt and only then sends it and<br>
removes from that queue.<br>
Even thought there might be newer beacon data already available for<br>
transmission.<br>
<br>
And then these "unsent" beacons pile up in queue and the delays I am<br>
observing are simply old queued beacons (that don't have the DTIM bit<br>
set yet) being transmitted.<br>
<br>
But that's just my hypothesis - I don't know how rtl8192cu hardware<br>
actually works.<br>
