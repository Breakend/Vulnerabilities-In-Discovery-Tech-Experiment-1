The problem is that depends on is a real pain for users to find their<br>
drivers. This is why we have a ton of select, because the kconfig ui tends<br>
to suck.<br>
<br>
If you want to change this, we need automatic conflict resolution like apt<br>
and other package managers have, with suggestions how to fix the config if<br>
you want to enable a driver, but some of its requirements are missing. The<br>
current approach of hiding driver symbols complete if any of their<br>
dependencies are off is really not great.<br>
