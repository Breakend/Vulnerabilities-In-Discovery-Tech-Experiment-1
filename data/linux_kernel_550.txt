I don't like both names, because for someone who is only halfway into<br>
PWM stuff it is not understandable. Maybe ALLOW_PHASE_SHIFT?<br>
When a consumer is only interested in the power output than<br>
<br>
	.period = 20<br>
	.duty_cycle = 5<br>
<br>
would also be an allowed response for the request<br>
<br>
	.period = 200<br>
	.duty_cycle = 50<br>
<br>
and this is not what is in the focus here.<br>
<br>
