I'm not sure I understand you.  Before TP4040 there is only the MDTS,<br>
which only applies to data transfer commands, although we also<br>
"volunarily" apply it to Write Zeroes.  If MDTS is wrong this would<br>
also affect normal I/O, so we really either need a firmware update<br>
or a quirk.  Or is the Write Zeroes limit even smaller than MTDS?<br>
I'd rather not add another quirk with a specific limit in that case,<br>
as well grow way too many of those.  TP4040 is the way to go for that<br>
case.<br>
