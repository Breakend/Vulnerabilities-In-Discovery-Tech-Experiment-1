For OpenRISC I did ack the patch to convert to<br>
CONFIG_ARCH_USE_QUEUED_SPINLOCKS_XCHG32=y.  But I think you are right, the<br>
generic code in xchg_tail and the xchg16 emulation code in produced by OpenRISC<br>
using xchg32 would produce very similar code.  I have not compared instructions,<br>
but it does seem like duplicate functionality.<br>
<br>
Why doesn't RISC-V add the xchg16 emulation code similar to OpenRISC?  For<br>
OpenRISC we added xchg16 and xchg8 emulation code to enable qspinlocks.  So<br>
one thought is with CONFIG_ARCH_USE_QUEUED_SPINLOCKS_XCHG32=y, can we remove our<br>
xchg16/xchg8 emulation code?<br>

For the record, the latest qspinlock code doesn't use xchg8 anymore. It 
still need xchg16, though.
