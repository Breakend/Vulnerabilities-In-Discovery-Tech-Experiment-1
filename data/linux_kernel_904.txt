Random drivers should not override a user configuration of core knobs<br>
(e.g., CONFIG_DMA_CMA=n). Use "imply" instead, to still respect<br>
dependencies and manual overrides.<br>
<br>
"This is similar to "select" as it enforces a lower limit on another<br>
   symbol except that the "implied" symbol's value may still be set to n<br>
   from a direct dependency or with a visible prompt."<br>
<br>
Implying DRM_CMA should be sufficient, as that depends on CMA.<br>
<br>
Note: If this is a real dependency, we should use "depends on DMA_CMA"<br>
instead -  but I assume the driver can work without CMA just fine --<br>
esp. when we wouldn't have HAVE_DMA_CONTIGUOUS right now.<br>

<br>
'imply' is almost never the right solution, and it tends to cause more<br>
problems than it solves.<br>

<br>
I thought that was the case with "select" :)<br>

I assume you meant "DRM_CMA=n" ? DRM_CMA cannot be built as a module.<br>

I don't follow. "DRM_CMA=n" and 'DRMA_ASPEED_GFX=y' is supposed to work<br>
just fine (e.g., without HAVE_DMA_CONTIGUOUS) or what am I missing?<br>

If you want this kind of soft dependency, you need<br>
'depends on DRM_CMA || !DRM_CMA'.<br>

<br>
Seriously? I think the point of imply is "please enable if possible and<br>
not prevented by someone else". Your example looks more like a NOP - no?<br>
Or will it have the same effect?<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
I just tried (remove CONFIG_DMA_CMA from .config followed by make) and 
the default will be set to "N" (when querying the user). So it indeed 
looks like a NOP - unless I am missing something.
