Almost, the above is actually OK on RT. The problematic one is:<br>
<br>
	local_irq_disable();<br>
	spin_lock(&lock);<br>
<br>
That doesn't work on RT since spin_lock() turns into a PI-mutex which<br>
then obviously explodes if it tries to block with IRQs disabled.<br>
<br>
And it so happens, that's exactly the one at hand.<br>
