Again, we can worry about lockdep stuff for the real places where it<br>
matters, which should not have been the same place as all of these were<br>
used (they were used very infrequently.)<br>

I don't want to use printk_deffered() if at all possible, let's let the<br>
printk developers fix up their implementation which should make that<br>
change not needed.<br>
<br>
And worst case, take the few places that really really really need it,<br>
and call printk_deferred() so it's obvious what we are doing.<br>

Huh?  No.<br>

<br>
Again, no.  If we really need to deferr a printk, let's call that, but<br>
that should not be the case for all of the places these macros were<br>
used.<br>
