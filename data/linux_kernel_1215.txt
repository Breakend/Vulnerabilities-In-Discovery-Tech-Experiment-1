Sometimes the notifications are not triggered when there is a conflict<br>
when applying the patch from patchwork directly. I usually answer<br>
manually in this case but I might have forgotten.<br>
<br>
About the patch, I felt it was good enough for merging, and I want to<br>
avoid applying such patches right before freezing our branches. Hence,<br>
I tend to be more aggressive earlier in the release cycles because I<br>
hate when my patches get delayed infinitely. The other side is a more<br>
careful approach when -rc6 gets tagged so that I can drop anything which<br>
would be crazily broken before our -next branches are stalled, leading<br>
for an useless public revert. Of course, I am fully open to removing<br>
this patch from -next if you ever feel it was too early and will<br>
happily get rid of it for this release: we can move the patch for the<br>
next release if you agree on this (especially since it touches the<br>
ABI).<br>
<br>
