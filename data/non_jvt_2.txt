 recently heard JVT and found this . As it states,

    JVT is used for synchronous process. It uses Java Objects for communications. Java Objects are sent across the networks.

I googled on it, but couldn't find any useful sources. Any one has a good explanation with how JVT goes in Java and when, how, where... JVT is useful?

I also found from here

    The Java Vision Toolkit (JVT) is a Java Advanced Imaging GUI/library for machine vision and image processing applications. It provides a framework for machine vision and image processing algorithms for 2D and 3D images.

first of all, what is JMS? : Java Message Service (JMS) is an application program interface (API) from Sun Microsystems that supports the formal communication known as messaging between computers in a network. here message can be of any type (Integer, Float, string) and of any size. Like in Socket programming, we use some API to send messages across network.

now, how JVT is related to JMS? : JVT (Java Value Type) is manages entities. it is like an Object. as i specified above, JMS is used to send messages across network and this message can be of any type. This message can also be mixture of types (int + String). to clarify this look at example below:

class CustomerJVT{
     int CustomerId
     String CustomerName
}

Here CustomerJVT is JVT which we can send on network using JMS library easily instead of sending CustomerId and CustomerName separately. isn't it good?

I hope it clarifies your issue. If you need any further clarification than let me know.

Thanks,
