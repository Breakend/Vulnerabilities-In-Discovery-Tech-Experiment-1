Which part of it?<br>
<br>
If there is a driver/subsystem code that can't handle the reverse <br>
operation to modprobe, it clearly can't handle error handling during <br>
modprobe (which, one would hope, is supported), and should be fixed.<br>
<br>
If there is a particular issue in kernel dynamic linker that causes crash <br>
on module removal, we'd better off fixing it. Is there one such that makes <br>
you claim module removal unsupported?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
