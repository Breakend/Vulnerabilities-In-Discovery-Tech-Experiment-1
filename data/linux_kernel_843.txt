For both patches:<br>
Acked-by: Nicolin Chen <nicoleotsuka@xxxxxxxxx><br>
Tested-by: Nicolin Chen <nicoleotsuka@xxxxxxxxx><br>
<br>
The WAR looks good to me. Perhaps Thierry would give some input.<br>
<br>
Another topic:<br>
I think this may help work around the mc-errors, which we have<br>
been facing on Tegra210 also when we enable IOMMU_DOMAIN_DMA.<br>
(attached a test patch rebasing on these two)<br>
<br>
However, GPU would also report errors using DMA domain:<br>
<br>

<br>
Looking at the address, seems that GPU allocated memory in 32-bit<br>
physical address space behind SMMU, so a violation happened after<br>
turning on DMA domain I guess... <br>
