This series proposes a set of improvements and new features for the<br>
tracing subsystem to facilitate the debugging of low latency<br>
deployments.<br>
<br>
Currently, hwlat runs on a single CPU at a time, migrating across a<br>
set of CPUs in a round-robin fashion. The first three patches are<br>
changes made to allow hwlat to run on multiple CPUs in parallel,<br>
increasing the chances of detecting a hardware latency.<br>
<br>
The fourth patch is a helper to print a timestamp in a u64 in<br>
seconds.nanoseconds format on tracepoints.<br>
<br>
The fifth patch proposes a new tracer named osnoise and aims to help<br>
users of isolcpus= (or a similar method) to measure how much noise the<br>
OS and the hardware add to the isolated application. The osnoise tracer<br>
bases on the hwlat detector code. The difference is that, instead of<br>
sampling with interrupts disabled, the osnoise tracer samples the CPU with<br>
interrupts and preemption enabled. In this way, the sampling thread will<br>
suffer any source of noise from the OS. The detection and classification<br>
of the type of noise are then made by observing the entry points of NMIs,<br>
IRQs, SoftIRQs, and threads. If none of these sources of noise is detected,<br>
the tool associates the noise with the hardware. The tool periodically<br>
prints a status, printing the total noise of the period, the max single<br>
noise observed, the percentage of CPU available for the task, along with<br>
the counters of each source of the noise. To debug the sources of noise,<br>
the tracer also adds a set of tracepoints that print any NMI, IRQ, SofIRQ,<br>
and thread occurrence. These tracepoints print the starting time and the<br>
noise's net duration at the end of the noise. In this way, it reduces the<br>
number of tracepoints (one instead of two) and the need to manually<br>
accounting the contribution of each noise independently.<br>
