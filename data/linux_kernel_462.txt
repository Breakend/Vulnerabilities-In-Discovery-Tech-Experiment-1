As promised, I have looked at this with a fresh eye and NAK from me. Sorry.<br>
This is less than a half baked solution. I spent couple of evenings, so<br>
I'll come up with full conversion of this driver to the bitmap API.<br>
And yes, as I have told you like half a year before, bitmap_get_value32() and<br>
bitmap_set_value32() is much more useful (and I actually implemented them<br>
locally for the sake of conversion).<br>
<br>
So, summarize this I do not think we have real users of the proposed API.<br>
