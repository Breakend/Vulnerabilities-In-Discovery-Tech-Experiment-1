Ouch. This series would be good for clean up, but this series might be<br>
bad for handling lockdep warning syzbot is reporting.<br>
<br>
Since tty_warn() is using plain printk(), we can avoid lockdep warning by<br>
using printk_deferred(). If we use dev_warn() instead, we need to modify<br>
__dev_printk() to use printk_deferred(), which means that all dev_*() users<br>
are affected by this change.<br>
<br>
Also, we need to modify dev_printk_emit()/dev_vprintk_emit() callers to embed<br>
loglevel into the format string so that we pass LOGLEVEL_SCHED to vprintk_emit() ...<br>
maybe just change from "if (!in_sched)" to "if (!in_sched && !dev_info)" instead ?<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, dev_vprintk_emit() need to start calling defer_console_output()<br>
after returning from vprintk_emit() in order to behave like printk_deferred().<br>
<br>
I'm not sure whether this change is safe.<br>
