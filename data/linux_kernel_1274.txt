This patch adds a shutdown callback to USB DWC core driver to ensure that<br>
it is properly shutdown in reboot/shutdown path. This is required<br>
where SMMU address translation is enabled like on SC7180<br>
SoC and few others. If the hardware is still accessing memory after<br>
SMMU translation is disabled as part of SMMU shutdown callback in<br>
system reboot or shutdown path, then IOVAs(I/O virtual address)<br>
which it was using will go on the bus as the physical addresses which<br>
might result in unknown crashes (NoC/interconnect errors).<br>
<br>
Previously this was added in dwc3 qcom glue driver.<br>

But observed kernel panic as glue driver shutdown getting called after<br>
iommu shutdown. As we are adding iommu nodes in dwc core node<br>
in device tree adding shutdown callback in core driver seems correct.<br>

So shouldn't you also remove this from the qcom glue driver at the same<br>
time?  Please submit both as a patch series.<br>
<br>
thanks,<br>

Hi Greg,<br>
<br>
The qcom glue driver patch is not merged yet. I have just mentioned<br>
for it for reference.<br>
</blockquote>
You know that we can not add callbacks for no in-kernel user, so what<br>
good is this patch for now?<br>
<br>
</blockquote>
What in-kernel user? Since when does shutdown callback need an<br>
in-kernel<br>
user? When you reboot or shutdown a system, it gets called. The reason<br>
why the shutdown callback is needed is provided in the commit text.<br>
</blockquote>
As I can't see the patch here, I have no idea...<br>
</blockquote>
You are replying now to the same patch which adds this shutdown callback :)<br>
Anyways the qcom dwc3 driver patch which is abandoned which is also<br>
mentioned<br>
in the commit text is here [1] and the new shutdown callback patch which we<br>
are both replying to is in here [2]<br>

Thanks, so, what am I supposed to do here?  The patch is long gone from<br>
my queue...<br>

Hi Greg,<br>
<br>
Should I resend this patch ? If so let me know your about opinion about 
Stephen's comment on just calling dwc3_remove in
<br>
<br>
dwc3_shutdown and ignoring return value.<br>
