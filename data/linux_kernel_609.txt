Thank you for clarification, guess I really misunderstood the question<br>
and didn't explain properly why I'm doing it.<br>
<br>
In this block of code call to r8712_find_network() exist only for one<br>
purpose, to return value to the pcur_wlan. And after that we're not<br>
using pcur_wlan.<br>
<br>
So in my opinion it looks like a very subtle bug where we have unused<br>
variable, which is allocated by r8712_find_network(), and if that<br>
succeeds we're also modifying value by pcur_wlan->fixed = false;.<br>
And after all that we're not using variable and compiler has no chance<br>
of catching that because of what we're doing with that value.<br>
<br>
Please correct me if I'm wrong in something, I just found that<br>
questionable behavior and decided to send patch, so someone can see<br>
it and say if I'm wrong or not. In case I'm right this change can be<br>
_possibly_ accepted.<br>
<br>
Also sorry for asking here, but is it okay that my commit has [PATCH v2]<br>
and subject is [PATCH v2] in mutt, but in mailing list I still see<br>
[PATCH]?<br>
<br>
Greg, thanks a lot for reviews of my code you did in past few days, I<br>
really appreciate that, but just didn't want to flood mailing list with<br>
my appreciation only.<br>
<br>
