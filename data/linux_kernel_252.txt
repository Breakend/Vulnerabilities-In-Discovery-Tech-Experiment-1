Although the Hyper-v TLFS mentions that a guest cannot use this feature<br>
unless the hypervisor advertises support for it, some hypercalls which<br>
we plan on upstreaming in future uses them anyway.<br>

No, please don't do this. Check the feature bit(s) before you issue<br>
hypercalls which rely on the extended interface.<br>

Perhaps Siddharth should clarify this, but I read it as Hyper-V being<br>
buggy and using XMM arguments unconditionally.<br>

The guest is at fault here as it expects Hyper-V to consume arguments<br>
from XMM registers for certain hypercalls (that we are working) even if<br>
we didn't expose the feature via CPUID bits.<br>
