'struct kvm_vcpu_hv' is only allocated when we emulate Hyper-V in KVM<br>
(run Windows/Hyper-V guests on top of KVM). Remote TLB flush is used<br>
when we run KVM on Hyper-V and this is a very different beast. Let's not<br>
mix these things together. I understand that some unification is needed<br>
to bring the AMD specific feature but let's do it differently.<br>
<br>
E.g. 'ept_pointer' and friends from 'struct kvm_vmx' can just go to<br>
'struct kvm_vcpu_arch' (in case they really need to be unified).<br>

Ahh yes, thanks for catching this. Will fix this in the next version.<br>
