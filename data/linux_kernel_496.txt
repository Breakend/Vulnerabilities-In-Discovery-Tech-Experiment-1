So what types of "differences" are you trying to detect?  If you need to detect<br>
differences caused by someone who maliciously made changes ("malicious" implies<br>
they may try to avoid detection), then you need to use a cryptographic hash<br>
function (or a cryptographic MAC if the hash value isn't stored separately).  If<br>
you only need to detect non-malicious changes (normally these would be called<br>
"accidental" changes, but sure, it could be changes that are "intentionally"<br>
made provided that the other side can be trusted to not try to avoid<br>
detection...), then a non-cryptographic checksum would be sufficient.<br>
