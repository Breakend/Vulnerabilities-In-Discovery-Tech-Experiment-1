Personally, I think it would be best to introduce a new, SMC64 only<br>
compatible (e.g. "qcom,scm-64" like I mentioned). Then you can skip the<br>
detection check for the boards that opt-in by adding the compatible.<br>
You can then use it on all newer boards/SoCs/firmwares where you know<br>
exactly that there is SMC64.<br>
<br>
I would just like to avoid breaking any existing boards where we don't<br>
know exactly if they have SMC32 or SMC64.<br>

In a perfect world the firmware would do that, but there is certainly<br>
no such mechanism on any of the old SoCs :/<br>

<br>
Ah okay, this sounds like a better reason than just trying to avoid the<br>
"overhead" of the detection step. :) I still think it should work if you<br>
just start marking all newer boards/SoCs/... as "qcom,scm-64" or<br>
something like that, right?<br>
<br>
