That does not make sense, this is only one kernel module, with one .h<br>
file in this patch, I do not see those other files you are talking<br>
about...<br>
<br>
And if you have named registers that are identical, and yet you only<br>
work on one device, that feels like a design flaw somewhere :)<br>
