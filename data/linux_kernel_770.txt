Aligning to MDTS is our current behavior, although all kernels up to<br>
5.11 had a bug in the calculation.<br>

I see. Let me check internally and see what's going on with<br>
write-zeroes on this model.<br>

<br>
We still need to confirm, but it seems like MDTS for write-zeroes is<br>
reported wrong in the FW that Dmitry is using. We can at least reproduce<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Would it be a possibility to add quirk infrastructure to hardcode MDTS<br>
for FW versions prior TP4040?<br>
<br>
Another possibility is to add quirks to the TP4040 support patches to<br>
enable this - it might also help reduce the list of models currently<br>
blacklisted for write-zeroes.<br>

<br>
I'm not sure I understand you.  Before TP4040 there is only the MDTS,<br>
which only applies to data transfer commands, although we also<br>
"volunarily" apply it to Write Zeroes.  If MDTS is wrong this would<br>
also affect normal I/O, so we really either need a firmware update<br>
or a quirk.  Or is the Write Zeroes limit even smaller than MTDS?<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
The latter. The Write Zeroes limit is smaller than MDTS.<br>

I'd rather not add another quirk with a specific limit in that case,<br>

<br>
This is what I had in mind - a structure with the quirks that would set<br>
the write zeroes limit for the cases prior to TP4040 and where this is<br>
lower than MDTS. But fair enough; I can see how painful it can be to<br>
maintain this.<br>

TP4040 is the way to go for that case.<br>

<br>
I agree TP4040 is the way to move forward.<br>
<br>
Here I have one question: How do you envision adding support for FW<br>
updates that add TP4040 support (or fix MDTS) with regards with existing<br>
quirks.<br>
