The original workload that I developed SPF for (waaaay back when) was<br>
prefaulting a single huge vma. Using a vma refcount was a total loss<br>
because it resulted in the same cacheline contention that down_read()<br>
was having.<br>
<br>
As such, I'm always incredibly sad to see mention of vma refcounts.<br>
They're fundamentally not solving the problem :/<br>
