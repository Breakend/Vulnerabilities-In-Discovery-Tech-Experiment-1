As I said, this is fine by me.<br>
I think it is the most straightforward way to proceed with this series<br>
as this is a problem that has been bugging us fore quite some time now.<br>
<br>
See below:<br>

Yes, those need to be removed<br>

Those could stay as well, but they mention a change in<br>
alloc_contig_range() and without the context of the whole patchset might<br>
be misleading, so I would pull those out as well.<br>
<br>

<br>
I think this one can stay.<br>
<br>
But if It is going to be easier for Andrew, just pull them all out and I<br>
will resend the whole series once this work goes in.<br>
<br>
