I'm afraid that's not a good idea since not all ttys have a<br>
corresponding class device. Notable exception include pseudo terminals<br>
and serdev.<br>
<br>
While dev_printk() can handle a NULL device argument without crashing,<br>
we'll actually lose log information by removing the tty printk helpers.<br>
