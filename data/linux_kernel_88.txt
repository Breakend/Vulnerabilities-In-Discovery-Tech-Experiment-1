I kind of share Greg's concern that people aren't going to want to do<br>
this; it could even be seen as an impediment to reporting problems in<br>
general.  If you *really* want random users to input this sort of<br>
information, you may well end up creating some sort of web page to step<br>
them through it.<br>
<br>
Also, though, as I understand it the system that will interpret these<br>
lines does not yet exist.  Experience tells me that, as this system<br>
comes into existence, you will have a good chance of deciding that you<br>
want the syntax to look different anyway.  So I would personally hold<br>
off on telling people to include directives like this until you have<br>
something that works with them.<br>
<br>
But that's just me... if this is the way it's going to work then the<br>
docs should of course reflect that.<br>
<br>
