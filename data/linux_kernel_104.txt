I'm not using DSA in my application, so I cannot test or replicate<br>
what you were observing. It would be great if we could work together<br>
and settle on a solution that is acceptable to both of us.<br>

Seen from my point of view, your patch is a regression. But perhaps my<br>
patch set is a regression for you? Catch 22...<br>
<br>
Would you be able to identify which patch broke your DSA behaviour?<br>
Was it one of mine? Perhaps we can start from there.<br>
