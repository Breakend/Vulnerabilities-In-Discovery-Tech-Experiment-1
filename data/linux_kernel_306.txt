It is possible most applications have been reviewed and scrubbed for SSB-type attacks but PSF-type issues may not have been looked at yet.<br>
This may be one of the cases where SSB is enabled but PSF is disabled until the application(s) are scrubbed for the same.<br>
<br>
In certain cases, disabling PSF may have less impact performance-wise than disabling SSB.<br>
