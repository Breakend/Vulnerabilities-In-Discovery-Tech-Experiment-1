This series adds support for ECDSA-signed kernel modules. It also<br>
attempts to address a kbuild issue where a developer created an ECDSA<br>
key for signing kernel modules and then builds an older version of the<br>
kernel, when bisecting the kernel for example, that does not support<br>
ECDSA keys.<br>
<br>
The first patch addresses the kbuild issue of needing to delete that<br>
ECDSA key if it is in certs/signing_key.pem and trigger the creation<br>
of an RSA key. However, for this to work this patch would have to be<br>
backported to previous versions of the kernel but would also only work<br>
for the developer if he/she used a stable version of the kernel to which<br>
this patch was applied. So whether this patch actually achieves the<br>
wanted effect is not always guaranteed.<br>
<br>
The 2nd patch adds the support for the ECSDA-signed kernel modules.<br>
<br>
This patch depends on the ECDSA support series currently queued here:<br>
