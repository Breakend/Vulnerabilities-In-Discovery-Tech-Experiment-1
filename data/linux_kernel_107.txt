Similarly, because the meaning of those CPUs doesn't differ or change between architectures.<br>
<br>
I've expanded the middle paragraph in the commit message to explain why the arch specific<br>
things are arch specific:<br>
| Continue by splitting struct rdt_domain, into an architecture private<br>
| 'hw' struct, which contains the common resctrl structure that would be<br>

|<br>
| The hardware values in ctrl_val and mbps_val need to be accessed via<br>

| format if necessary.<br>
|<br>
| After this split, filesystem code code paths touching a 'hw' struct<br>

<br>
and similarly changed the kernel doc comment.<br>

Let me know if you prefer some other struct name.<br>
