They are not in the "free_page_list" before sanitization process has put<br>
them to there. So in that way the count is also better in sync with this<br>
fix.<br>
<br>
It was even before NUMA patches kind of out-of-sync, i.e. free pages count<br>
was incremented before putting them to the free list, but it didn't matter<br>
that much because sanitization is fairly fast and it only prevented ksgxd<br>
to trigger small time after the booth.<br>
<br>
I think I'll send the fix for this now as a separate patch with a better<br>
descriptino so that I can use more time to the attributes and implement<br>
that properly at once.<br>
