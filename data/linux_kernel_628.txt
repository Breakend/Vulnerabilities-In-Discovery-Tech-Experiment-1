This patchset is attempt to add CoW support for fsdax, and take XFS,<br>
which has both reflink and fsdax feature, as an example.<br>
<br>
Changes from V3:<br>
 - Take out the first 3 patches as a cleanup patchset[1], which has been<br>
    sent yesterday.<br>
 - Fix usage of code in dax_iomap_cow_copy()<br>
 - Add comments for macro definitions<br>
 - Fix other code style problems and mistakes<br>
<br>
Changes from V2:<br>
 - Fix the mistake in iomap_apply2() and dax_dedupe_file_range_compare()<br>
 - Add CoW judgement in dax_iomap_zero()<br>
 - Fix other code style problems and mistakes<br>
<br>
Changes from V1:<br>
 - Factor some helper functions to simplify dax fault code<br>
 - Introduce iomap_apply2() for dax_dedupe_file_range_compare()<br>
 - Fix mistakes and other problems<br>
 - Rebased on v5.11<br>
<br>
One of the key mechanism need to be implemented in fsdax is CoW.  Copy<br>
the data from srcmap before we actually write data to the destance<br>
iomap.  And we just copy range in which data won't be changed.<br>
<br>
Another mechanism is range comparison.  In page cache case, readpage()<br>
is used to load data on disk to page cache in order to be able to<br>
compare data.  In fsdax case, readpage() does not work.  So, we need<br>
another compare data with direct access support.<br>
<br>
With the two mechanism implemented in fsdax, we are able to make reflink<br>
and fsdax work together in XFS.<br>
<br>
Some of the patches are picked up from Goldwyn's patchset.  I made some<br>
changes to adapt to this patchset.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Rebased on v5.12-rc5 and patchset[1])<br>
