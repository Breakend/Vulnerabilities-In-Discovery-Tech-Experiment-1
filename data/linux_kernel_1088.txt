Thanks. I looked at your code and I see a difference between the<br>
implementations.<br>
<br>
As far as I understand, pages are always assumed to be aligned to their<br>
own sizes. I therefore assume that flushes should regard the lower bits<br>
as a “mask” and not just as encoding of the size.<br>
<br>
In the version that you referred me to, iommu_update_domain_tlb() only<br>
regards the size of the region to be flushed and disregards the<br>
alignment:<br>
<br>
+	order   = get_order(domain->flush.end - domain->flush.start);<br>
+	mask    = (0x1000ULL << order) - 1;<br>
+	address = ((domain->flush.start & ~mask) | (mask >> 1)) & ~0xfffULL;<br>
<br>
<br>
If you need to flush for instance the region between 0x1000-0x5000, this<br>
version would use the address|mask of 0x1000 (16KB page). The version I<br>
sent regards the alignment, and since the range is not aligned would use<br>
address|mask of 0x3000 (32KB page).<br>
<br>
IIUC, IOVA allocations today are aligned in such way, but at least in<br>
the past (looking on 3.19 for the matter), it was not like always like<br>
that, which can explain the problems.<br>
<br>
Thoughts?
