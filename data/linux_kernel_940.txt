The de-facto standard for how to handle change requests for<br>
non-supported features (e.g. changing the I/O port or IRQ) is to simply<br>
ignore them and return 0.<br>
<br>
For most (non-legacy) serial devices the only relevant parameters are<br>
close_delay and closing_wait. And as we need to return -EPERM when a<br>
non-privileged user tries to change these, we cannot drop the test.<br>
<br>
(And returning -EOPNOTSUPP was never correct as the ioctl is indeed<br>
supported.)<br>
