But then why don't you just use reg_ext to store SOC_VR_HOT_THRESHOLD_REG<br>
or MEM_HOT_THRESHOLD_REG ? It is already available, after all, and with it<br>
the code could be simplified to<br>
<br>
         ret = regmap_read(hwmon->regmap, temperature[channel].reg_ext, &value);<br>
         if (ret)<br>
             return ret;<br>

Thank you for the comment.<br>
<br>
Will change code follow this suggestion, will include in next version<br>

I don't have a datasheet, but I do wonder what is in bit 9..15. Any idea ?<br>
Main question is if there is a sign bit, as theoretic as it may be.<br>

The original intention was to use this as 9-bit 2-complement value follow LM75, but the fact is that the operation temperature is 0-125 C degree, so we simply use it as-is.<br>

The operational temperature is not the question here. The question is if the<br>
chip _reports_ a sign. If it does, it should be handled, even if it is outside<br>
the operational range. The reported range is relevant here, not the operational<br>
range. After all, the chip won't really blow apart at -1 degrees C.<br>

I think I've got it, will handle the sign bit in next version.<br>
