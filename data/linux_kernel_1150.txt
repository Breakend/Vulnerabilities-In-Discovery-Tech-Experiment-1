Hi Greg, MFD driver is the start of everything. Once MFD driver is loading, it will spawn 2 devices,  <br>
one is for phc driver, which is under /driver/ptp and the other one is for this misc driver.  <br>
Both PHC and misc drivers are operating on the same device. <br>
They are both calling exported functions from mfd drivers to access the device through i2c/spi <br>
and the register definitions are located in include/Linux/mfd/idt8a340_reg.h or idt82p33_reg.h<br>
depending on which device was found by mfd driver through device tree node.<br>
<br>
