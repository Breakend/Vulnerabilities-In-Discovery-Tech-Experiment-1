Admittedly, I'm not exactly sure what you mean by a "standard slot".<br>
Our PCIIe HW does not support  hotplug or have a presence bit or<br>
anything like that.  Our root complex has one port; it can only<br>
directly connect to a single switch or endpoint. This connection shows<br>
up as slot0.  The voltage regulator(s) involved depend on a GPIO that<br>
turns the power  on/off for the connected device/chip.  The gpio pin<br>
can vary from board to board but this is easily handled in our DT.<br>
Some boards have regulators that are always on and not associated with<br>
a GPIO pin -- these have no representation in our DT.<br>
<br>
