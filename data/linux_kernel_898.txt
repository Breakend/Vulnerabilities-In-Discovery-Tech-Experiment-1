I agree on the part of removing the 'select' if we don't need it. The<br>
part I couldn't figure out was what the 'imply' is supposed to help with.<br>
Most other users that added imply tried (and failed) to fix a build problem.<br>

I can probably find a couple more, but regardless of how many others<br>
exist, this would be a much clearer way of doing it than 'imply' since it<br>
has none of the ambiguity and misuse problems.<br>
<br>
I think the reason we don't see more is that generally speaking, those<br>
defaults are widely ignored anyway. You almost always start out with<br>
a defconfig file that contains everything you know you need, and then<br>
you add bits to that. Having the default in any form only helps to<br>
make that defconfig file one line shorter, while requiring other users<br>
to add another line to turn it off when they do not want it.<br>
