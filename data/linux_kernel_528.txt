I think the same info will be printed here as before, just some NULL<br>
information at the beginning, right?  And the benifits overall (for real<br>
tty devices), should outweigh the few devices that do not have this<br>
information.<br>
<br>
But let me run some tests, on those devices to see just how this<br>
looks...<br>
