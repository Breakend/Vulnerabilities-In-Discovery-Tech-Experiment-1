I don't think there should be a problem because now the struct pages for<br>
UEFI/ACPI never got to be used by the core mm. They were (rightfully)<br>
skipped by memblock_free_all() from one side and pfn_valid() and<br>
pfn_valid_within() return false for them in various pfn walkers from the<br>
other side.<br>

I surely have no access for such machines :)<br>
