Yes all of them are from TLFS. We are implementing VSM and there are a<br>
bunch of hypercalls that we have implemented to manage VTL switches,<br>
memory protection and virtual interrupts.<br>
<br>
The following 3 hypercalls that use the XMM fast hypercalls are relevant<br>
to this patch set:<br>

HvCallModifyVtlProtectionMask<br>
HvGetVpRegisters <br>
HvSetVpRegisters <br>
