Yes, that's right, we'll take on this part.<br>

We've reached the stage with our prototyping where not having the OVMF<br>
support is blocking us from working on QEMU.  If we're going to have to<br>
reinvent the wheel in OVMF because Google is unwilling to publish the<br>
patches, can you at least give some hints about how you did it?<br>
