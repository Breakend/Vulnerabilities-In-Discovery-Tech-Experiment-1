Quick question. It seems like the current quirk simply disables<br>
write-zeroes. Would you be open for a quirk that aligns with MDTS for<br>
models that implemented it this way before TP4040?<br>

<br>
Aligning to MDTS is our current behavior, although all kernels up to<br>
5.11 had a bug in the calculation.<br>

<br>
I see. Let me check internally and see what's going on with<br>
write-zeroes on this model.<br>

We still need to confirm, but it seems like MDTS for write-zeroes is<br>
reported wrong in the FW that Dmitry is using. We can at least reproduce<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Would it be a possibility to add quirk infrastructure to hardcode MDTS<br>
for FW versions prior TP4040?<br>
<br>
Another possibility is to add quirks to the TP4040 support patches to<br>
enable this - it might also help reduce the list of models currently<br>
blacklisted for write-zeroes.<br>
