I'm still not sure what you are trying to achieve. Is the idea only to provide<br>
a useful default for DMA_CMA depending on which drivers are enabled?<br>
<br>
This is something you could do using a hidden helper symbol like<br>
<br>
config DRMA_ASPEED_GFX<br>
       bool "Aspeed display driver"<br>
       select DRM_WANT_CMA<br>
<br>
config DRM_WANT_CMA<br>
       bool<br>
       help<br>
          Select this from any driver that benefits from CMA being enabled<br>
<br>
config DMA_CMA<br>
       bool "Use CMA helpers for DRM"<br>
       default DRM_WANT_CMA<br>
<br>
         Arnd<br>
<br>
<br>
