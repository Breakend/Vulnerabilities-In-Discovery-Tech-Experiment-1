As I was afraid in the cover letter, I found some mistakes already.<br>
In any case, I'll wait for the comments and test of other patches if possible.<br>
<br>
Out of curiosity, below I point out the issues.<br>

Seems we have to use 64 instead of ngpio here.<br>

Ditto.<br>

<br>
Ditto.<br>

<br>
Here should be used gpio actually and ngpio IIUC.<br>
