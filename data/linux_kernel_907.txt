'imply' is almost never the right solution, and it tends to cause more<br>
problems than it solves.<br>
<br>
In particular, it does not prevent a configuration with 'DRM_CMA=m'<br>
and 'DRMA_ASPEED_GFX=y', or any build failures from such<br>
a configuration.<br>
<br>
If you want this kind of soft dependency, you need<br>
'depends on DRM_CMA || !DRM_CMA'.<br>
