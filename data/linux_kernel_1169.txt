All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next<br>
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during<br>
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if<br>
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.<br>
<br>
You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing<br>
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and<br>
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.<br>
<br>
If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they<br>
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing<br>
patches will not be replaced.<br>
<br>
Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying<br>
to this mail.<br>
