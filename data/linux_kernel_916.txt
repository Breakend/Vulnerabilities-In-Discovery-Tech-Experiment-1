Thanks all for your input! We'll make the below changes as suggested:<br>
<br>
Microsoft Azure Network Device ==> Microsoft Network Devices<br>
Drop the default m<br>
validated ==> supported<br>
<br>
We'll also fix some warnings reported by "kernel test robot".<br>
<br>
Will post v3 later today.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
