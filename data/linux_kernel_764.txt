Hi all,<br>
<br>
Today's linux-next merge of the akpm-current tree got a conflict in:<br>
<br>
  Makefile<br>
<br>
between commit:<br>
<br>
  2f8864dbe668 ("kbuild: move module strip/compression code into scripts/Makefile.modinst")<br>
<br>
from the kbuild tree and commit:<br>
<br>
  7b35c1a01c2e ("init: add support for zstd compressed modules")<br>
<br>
from the akpm-current tree.<br>
<br>
Also commit<br>
<br>
  ee2305118fc3 ("kbuild: add support for zstd compressed modules")<br>
<br>
from the kbuild tree seems to do the same as the akpm-current commit<br>
above, so I just effectively reverted the akpm-current commit.<br>
<br>
I fixed it up (see above) and can carry the fix as necessary. This<br>
is now fixed as far as linux-next is concerned, but any non trivial<br>
conflicts should be mentioned to your upstream maintainer when your tree<br>
is submitted for merging.  You may also want to consider cooperating<br>
with the maintainer of the conflicting tree to minimise any particularly<br>
complex conflicts.<br>
<br>

Cheers,<br>
