PCIe PMU Root Complex Integrated End Point(RCiEP) device is supported<br>
to sample bandwidth, latency, buffer occupation etc.<br>
<br>
Each PMU RCiEP device monitors multiple root ports, and each RCiEP is<br>
registered as a pmu in /sys/bus/event_source/devices, so users can<br>
select target PMU, and use filter to do further sets.<br>
<br>
Filtering options contains:<br>
event        - select the event.<br>
subevent     - select the subevent.<br>
port         - select target root ports. Information of root ports<br>
                are shown under sysfs.<br>
bdf           - select requester_id of target EP device.<br>
trig_len     - set trigger condition for starting event statistics.<br>
trigger_mode - set trigger mode. 0 means starting to statistic when<br>
                bigger than trigger condition, and 1 means smaller.<br>
thr_len      - set threshold for statistics.<br>
thr_mode     - set threshold mode. 0 means count when bigger than<br>
                threshold, and 1 means smaller.<br>

Hi Will,<br>
<br>
Are you implying that you would rather that any review for these drivers 
is done in public on the lists?
<br>
