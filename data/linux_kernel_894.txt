+1 to this.. <br>

Though Kconfig is basically already unusuable unless you have hours to<br>
carefully craft the kconfig you need to get out.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure trying to optimize this by abusing the existing language<br>
rules is such a good idea.<br>
<br>
I gave a very half hearted go at a simple heuristic solution solve for<br>
kconfig a while ago. It is good enough to sometimes automate a kconfig<br>
task, but it is not so nice.<br>
<br>
I use it to do things like "turn on all RDMA drivers" which is quite<br>
a hard to do by hand.<br>
<br>
It looks liked heursitics need a lot of fine tuning as the<br>
conditionals are complex enough that it is hard to guess which branch<br>
is going to yield a success.<br>
