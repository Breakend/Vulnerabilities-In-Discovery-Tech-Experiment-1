Well, VMCS is also a structure in memory, isn't it? It's just that we<br>
don't have a 'clean field' concept for it and we can't use normal memory<br>
accesses.<br>

Yes, you are right. I was referring to the fact that we cant use normal<br>
memory accesses, but is a bit mis-worded.<br>

Do I understand correctly that we can just look at CPUID.0x40000000.EAX<br>
and in case it is >= 0x4000000A we can read HYPERV_CPUID_NESTED_FEATURES<br>
leaf? I'd suggest we do that intead then.<br>

I agree, that is a better way to consolidate both the cases.<br>
Will change it in the next iteration. Probably the above code<br>
comment is not needed when we consolidate the cases here.<br>
