Hi,<br>
<br>
the idea here was that you are setting something else, if you are<br>
not changing a parameter that can be changed. That conclusion is<br>
dubious, but at the same time, this implementation can change<br>
only these two parameters. So can the test really be dropped<br>
as opposed to be modified?<br>
