Razvan,

So I'm not sure if this helps or not but we just tested Janus and I was able to connect our device using that. I must have something wrong with my webrtc gateway approach in rtpengine. We would like to use opensips as it is more versatile at least we can prove not it isn't our devices. The packetization-mode was being set to one in the Janus example also.

Razvan,

Thanks for getting back to me. I was afraid of this as I didn't see any options in rtpengine that supported video codecs either. We are trying to upgrade some of our devices to support packetization-mode 0 and 1.

Hi, Ryan!

I don't have that much experience with H.264, but my first instinct was to look into the rtpengine packetization feature. But unfortunately rtpengine does not support H.264 codecs, so I doubt this can help. But perhaps you could look into different transcoding solutions that do support H.264 transcoding.
