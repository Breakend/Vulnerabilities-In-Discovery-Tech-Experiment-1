This patch set fixes and improves the Partial Power Down mode for<br>
dwc2 core.<br>
It adds support for the following cases<br>
    1. Entering and exiting partial power down when a port is<br>
       suspended, resumed, port reset is asserted.<br>
    2. Exiting the partial power down mode before removing driver.<br>
    3. Exiting partial power down in wakeup detected interrupt handler.<br>
    4. Exiting from partial power down mode when connector ID.<br>
       status changes to "connId B<br>
<br>
It updates and fixes the implementation of dwc2 entering and<br>
exiting partial power down mode when the system (PC) is suspended.<br>
<br>
The patch set also improves the implementation of function handlers<br>
for entering and exiting host or device partial power down.<br>
<br>
NOTE: This is the second patch set in the power saving mode fixes<br>
series.<br>
This patch set is part of multiple series and is continuation<br>
of the "usb: dwc2: Fix and improve power saving modes" patch set.<br>
(Patch set link: <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=160379622403975&w=2">https://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=160379622403975&w=2</a>).<br>
The patches that were included in the "usb: dwc2:<br>
Fix and improve power saving modes" which was submitted<br>
earlier was too large and needed to be split up into<br>
smaller patch sets.<br>
<br>
Changes since V2:<br>
No changes in the patches or the source code.<br>
Assuming that the issue due to which the patches are not reaching to<br>
vger.kernel.org is a comma in the end of To: or Cc: lists removed<br>
commas in the end of those lists in each email of patches.<br>
