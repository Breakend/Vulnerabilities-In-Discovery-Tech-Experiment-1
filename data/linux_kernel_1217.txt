Michael,<br>
<br>
Would you please resend this patch, together with the mtd-utils<br>
and the SPI NOR patch in a single patch set? You'll help us all<br>
having all in a single place.<br>
<br>
For the new ioctl we'll need acks from all the mtd maintainers<br>
and at least a tested-by tag.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
ta<br>
