No :-(<br>

They are triggering some case where multiple threads in a process hit the same<br>
poison, and somehow memory_failure() fails to complete offlining the page. At this<br>
point any other threads that hit that page get the early return from memory_failure<br>
(because the page flags say it is poisoned) ... and so we loop.<br>
<br>
But the "recover from cases where multiple machine checks happen<br>
simultaneously" case is orthogonal to the "do the right thing to recover<br>
when the kernel touches poison at a user address". So I think we can<br>
tackle them separately<br>
