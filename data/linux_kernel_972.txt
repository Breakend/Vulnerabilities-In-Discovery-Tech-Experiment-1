Yes, though it's not in the scope for this initial series*, I plan to add that.<br>
<br>
I was thinking about introducing a wwan_register_ndev or<br>
wwan_attach_ndev. Most of the time, netdev does not have reference to<br>
related existing (or future) control ports (they are different<br>
drivers), so we may need something like a 'context_id' for both ndev<br>
and control ports that can be used for linking them when necessary.<br>
Then, this relation could be represented as e.g a sysfs link to ndev<br>
device(s)... That's just a possible approach, I'll be happy to discuss<br>
this further.<br>
<br>
* Note: Userspace tools like ModemManager are able to link control<br>
ports and netdev by looking at the sysfs hierarchy, it's fine for<br>
simple connection management, but probably not enough for 'multi PDN'<br>
support for which devices may have multiple netdev and ports<br>
targetting different 'PDN contexts'...<br>
