Nit:  Most other similar lines put the colon in a different place:<br>
<br>
		pr_info("Hyper-V: nested features 0x%x\n",<br>
<br>
One of these days, I'm going to fix the ones that don't follow this<br>
pattern. :-)<br>

Any reason not to use pr_fmt?<br>

Yes, that would be the best way to go. As Michael suggested,<br>
it would be better to fix the whole file as a cleanup patch.<br>
I shall fix this one to conform to the previous style and use<br>
pr_fmt as a separate fixup patch.<br>
