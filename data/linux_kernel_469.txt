In current video driver, frequency is calculated for all the<br>
running video instances and check aganist maximum supported frequency.<br>
If both calculated frequency and maximum supported frequency are same,<br>
even then HW overload error is printed.<br>
Fix this by printing error log only when frequency is greater than<br>
maximum supported frequency.<br>
