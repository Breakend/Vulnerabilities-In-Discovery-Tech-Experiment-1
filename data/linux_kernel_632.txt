Maybe, I just think that in most cases we will only need xmm0. To make<br>
the optimization work we can probably do kvm_get_fpu() once we figured<br>
out that we're dealing with XMM hypercall and do kvm_put_fpu() when<br>
we're done processing hypercall parameters. This way we don't need to do<br>
get/put twice. We can certainly leave this idea to the (possible) future<br>
optimizations.<br>
