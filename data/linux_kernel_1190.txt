Just like any other taint. If a rmmod can cause the system to lose<br>
integrity, the rmmod could cause a subtle issue that manifests itself into<br>
something more serious and may look unrelated. If you have a bug report<br>
with the rmmod taint, one could ask to try to recreate the bug without<br>
doing rmmod. Or perhaps we have a similar bug reports that all show the<br>
rmmod taint. That would give us an impression that something was removed<br>
and caused the system to lose stability.<br>
