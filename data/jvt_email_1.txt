Folks,

in order to avoid excessive cross-posting I'm going to
answer on this Email only on the appropriate mailing
list, which is avt@ietf.org. (the reflector of the AVT group
in the IETF)  If you are not on this list, I would suggest to
subscribe.  See www.ietf.org for info how to subscribe to
IETF mailing lists.

Best regards
Stephan
